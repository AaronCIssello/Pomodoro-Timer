# Pomodoro-Timer

I realized this project following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEG6OVCass&t=926s

## Description

The project is fairly simple. A classic Pomodoro timer, with the inclusion of a counter for the number of work-break cycle during the session.
The user can select custom pomodoro session times, this allows the maximum possible productivity.

### Future features

<strong>Added!</strong>  <del>I'm working on adding the possibility for the user to choose between a set of different possible time, for example 30-5, 45-10 etc.</del>
<br>
<strong>Added!</strong>  <del>And also the possibility to use custom time.</del>

Lastly one feature i'm working on is the one that play some kind of alarm when the timer reaches the end.
